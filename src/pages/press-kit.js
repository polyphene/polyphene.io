                <p>Thanks for your interest in Evidence. Here are a few guidelines for using the brand resources.</p>

                <h3>Name</h3>
                <p>"Evidence" is one word spelled with a capital E.</p>

                <h3>Logos</h3>
                <img alt="Evidence logo" src={evidenceLogoBlack} width="256" />
                <p>You may download logos <a href={"https://cloud.evidence.fyi/s/s4M9cA7ZfgPT2p5/download"}>here</a> (2MB). They are available in multiple sizes, formats and colors. You will even find black and white assets.</p>

                <h3>Colors</h3>
                <p>Evidence Purple is our hero color.</p>
                <img alt="Evidence Purple color" src={evidencePurple} width="128" />
